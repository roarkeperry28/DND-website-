        <div class="recap-block">
          <h3>🐉 The Story So Far</h3>
          <p>
            Stormwreck Isle was only the beginning. While investigating strange draconic
            disturbances, your group uncovered the first signs of a much larger threat:
            <span class="recap-highlight">The Cult of the Dragon</span>, a fanatical order
            determined to bring Tiamat, the five-headed Chromatic Dragon Queen, into the world.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
            The cult has been attacking towns and villages across the Sword Coast, stealing gold,
            artifacts, and prisoners for unknown purposes. One of the hardest-hit towns was
            <span class="recap-highlight">Greennest</span>, a small settlement nearly destroyed
            by a sudden cult assault supported by half-dragons, drakes, and corrupted priests.
            Your party helped defend survivors, rescue families, and uncover the truth behind
            the attack.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
            The cult didn’t want one specific relic. They wanted <em>everything</em> — and the
            raid was part of a much wider plan.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="recap-block">
          <h3>🔥 Your Current Mission</h3>
          <p>
            A monk named <span class="recap-highlight">Leosin Erlanthar</span>, who had infiltrated
            the cult, revealed that many captured villagers — including himself — are being taken to
            a massive raiders’ camp hidden in a deep ravine several miles from town.
          </p>
          <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
            He asked the party to:
          </p>
          <ul class="recap-list">
            <li>Infiltrate the camp</li>
            <li>Rescue the prisoners</li>
            <li>Learn the cult’s true plan</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
            The cult is dangerous, disciplined, and growing stronger. Tonight, you infiltrate their camp.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="recap-block">
          <h3>⚠️ What You Know About the Cult</h3>
          <ul class="recap-list">
            <li>They serve <span class="recap-highlight">Tiamat, the Dragon Queen</span>.</li>
            <li>They believe the world must burn and be remade under chromatic dragons.</li>
            <li>They are collecting massive amounts of gold and treasure.</li>
            <li>They are led by <strong>Wyrmspeakers</strong>, elite half-dragon commanders.</li>
            <li>Their forces include human fanatics, kobolds, drakes, corrupted elemental cultists, and half-dragons.</li>
            <li>Their next step may be mobilizing an army.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="recap-block">
          <h3>🧩 New Characters Will Join in the Raider Camp</h3>
          <p>
            In the raider camp, the group discovers several powerful prisoners the cult feared too much
            to kill. These include:
          </p>
          <ul class="recap-list">
            <li><span class="recap-highlight">Elara Sunfang</span> — a cursed Blood Hunter, bound and muzzled because her lycanthropy is too dangerous.</li>
            <li><span class="recap-highlight">Syla Vaelora</span> — a deadly elven ranger, captured after killing several drakes on her own.</li>
            <li><span class="recap-highlight">ZOX</span> — an aasimar warlock, imprisoned because their psychic visions disturb the cult.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
            These characters will be freed during the mission and join the party for the escape.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="recap-block">
          <h3>🏹 The Next Session</h3>
          <p>You will:</p>
          <ul class="recap-list">
            <li>Enter the huge war camp.</li>
            <li>Sneak past guards and drakes.</li>
            <li>Free the prisoners.</li>
            <li>Meet the new characters.</li>
            <li>Battle cult fanatics.</li>
            <li>Face the half-dragon champion <strong>Cyanwrath</strong>.</li>
            <li>Confront cult commander <strong>Frulam Mondath</strong>.</li>
            <li>Escape through a massive riot you spark from inside.</li>
            <li>Learn the cult’s <span class="recap-highlight">true strategy</span>.</li>
            <li>And escape back to Greennest for the next phase of your journey.</li>
          </ul>
          <p style="margin-top:0.4rem;">
            This session is infiltration-heavy, roleplay-heavy, and packed with tense, dangerous moments.
          </p>

        <div class="recap-block">
          <h3>🌍 The Stakes</h3>
          <p>
            The Cult of the Dragon is preparing something massive — something world-shaking.
            If they are not stopped now, the Sword Coast may fall into the shadow of dragons.

            The party arrived on Stormwreck Isle expecting a simple voyage and found a monastery
            haunted by dragon ghosts, strange visions, and the first hints of the Hollow Flame.
            Bonds formed, secrets were teased, and someone definitely thought this was a party boat.

            Kobold cultists, corrupted altars, and storm-touched relics dragged the party deeper
            into the cult’s web. Blisterbark, the infernal musket, made its debut with a lot of
            attitude and questionable advice.
